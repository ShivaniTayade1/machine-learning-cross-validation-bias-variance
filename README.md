# machine-learning-cross-validation-bias-variance
This homework explores model selection through cross-validation, the bias-variance tradeoff via simulations, and regularization techniques (ridge/lasso). It concludes with a business-critical application: fraud detection on imbalanced data.

## Topics Covered
- Manual Implementation of k-Fold Cross-Validation
- Bias-Variance Tradeoff via Simulations
- Derivation of Ridge and Lasso Parameters
- Credit Card Fraud Detection with Cost-Based Metrics

## Key Libraries
- NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
